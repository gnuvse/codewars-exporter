Main idea is to parse all solutions to one file for uploading them to github

api - https://dev.codewars.com/

#### 1. setup application.

#### use once
```ruby
ruby bin/dev
```

#### 2. For using codewars-api (general information) functionality you should use:
```ruby
ruby bin/api
```

#### 3. If you want to parse your solutions just use:
```ruby
ruby bin/parse
```
program will save solutions to file in project folder (anyway check console it will hints u)
